.TH HSH 1 "Janvier 2026" "Simple Shell" "Holberton School Project"
.SH NAME
hsh \- A simple UNIX command language interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a custom command-line interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input. It is built as part of the Holberton School curriculum to understand the basics of process creation and environment management.
.PP
The shell displays a prompt, reads a command line, finds the executable command in the system \fBPATH\fR, and executes it in a child process.
.SH INVOCATION
.B hsh
starts in interactive mode when executed.
.PP
.B Prompt:
The shell uses the prompt \fBinshell$\fR to indicate it is ready for input.
.PP
Example:
.br
$ ./hsh
.br
inshell$ ls
.br
main.c  main.h  man_1_simple_shell
.br
inshell$ /bin/pwd
.br
/home/user/simple_shell
.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
The shell execution cycle is as follows:
.IP 1.
.B Reading:
Reads a line from standard input using \fBgetline(3)\fR.
.IP 2.
.B Parsing:
Removes the newline character at the end of the input.
.IP 3.
.B Path Resolution:
The function \fBfind_path\fR checks the \fBPATH\fR environment variable. It tokenizes the PATH directories and appends the user's command to search for an executable file.
.IP 4.
.B Execution:
Uses \fBfork(2)\fR to create a child process. The child process replaces its image using \fBexecve(2)\fR with the found path and the current environment.
.IP 5.
.B Waiting:
The parent process waits for the child to finish using \fBwaitpid(2)\fR before displaying the prompt again.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.B hsh
inherits the environment variables from its parent process. It specifically uses:
.TP
.B PATH
A colon-separated list of directories used to search for commands.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.B hsh
returns \fB0\fR upon successful completion.
.PP
If a command is not found in the PATH, it prints an error message to standard error:
.br
\fIcommand: command not found\fR
.br
and returns exit status \fB-1\fR internally (handled as an error).
.SH EXAMPLES
.B Interactive usage:
.br
$ ./hsh
.br
inshell$ ls
.br
inshell$ date
.SH BUGS
Currently, the shell processes the entire input line as a single command. It may not yet support command-line arguments (flags) depending on the exact tokenization implementation.
